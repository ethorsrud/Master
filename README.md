# Master

## todo
- Make the save_model and load_model work correctly
- Add batch normalization to the network aiming for faster improving results
- Downscale network aiming for time-reduction along with maintaining reasonable results

## /GAN

Code for
Hartmann, K. G., Schirrmeister, R. T., & Ball, T. (2018).
EEG-GAN: Generative adversarial networks for electroencephalograhic (EEG) brain signals.

## /VAE

Just testing varational autoencoder for image generation.
Currently configured for images using dataset from https://kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images
Can be configured for LFP/EEG in the future. Use `VAE_new` as your VAE
